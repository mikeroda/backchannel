Class project for a twitter-like back channel for use by students during lecture. 
Supports threaded posts like Facebook and ability to cheer other people's posts.

Tests:

Test::Unit, use command: rake test

Webrat integration tests, use command: rake test:integration

Low-level design decisions made:

a. The first account is automatically made an administrator. After logging in, an administrator will see links to administer accounts and access reports from the posts index page.
b. Users can edit and delete their own posts.
c. You cannot uncheer somebody else's cheer
d. You can reply to your own post
e. Users can edit their own name and password.
f. Top-level (depth 0) posts are sorted by creation date, most recent first.
g. Replies are shown under their parent post, sorted by creation date, oldest first.
h. Any administrator can edit any other account, but can only edit himself from the link on the posts index page.
i. Administrators cannot delete the account they are logged in as.
j. Administrators can create new posts and reply to posts also.
k. All deletes are cascaded to cleanup foreign key relationships
l. Searches return matching posts and their replies, or their parent if the matching post is a reply itself

Limitations / Suggestions for enhancements:

a. There is no paging through the posts.
b. You have to manually refresh the posts index, it doesn't do it automatically.
